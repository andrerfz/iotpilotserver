# ðŸš€ Updated IoT Pilot Server DDD Structure - Step 10

## ðŸ§ª Task 10: Phase 10 - Testing & Validation (3-5 days)

### ðŸŽ¯ Overview
This phase focuses on comprehensive testing and validation of the DDD architecture. We'll implement various types of tests to ensure the system works correctly, performs well, and maintains high code quality.

### ðŸ“‹ Tasks

#### Task 10.1: Implement Unit Tests
- Write unit tests for domain entities
- Write unit tests for value objects
- Write unit tests for domain services
- Write unit tests for application commands
- Write unit tests for application queries
- Write unit tests for repositories
- Write unit tests for infrastructure services

#### Task 10.2: Implement Integration Tests
- Create integration tests for API endpoints
- Create integration tests for database repositories
- Create integration tests for external services (MQTT, WebSocket)
- Create integration tests for command and query buses
- Create integration tests for event handling

#### Task 10.3: Implement End-to-End Tests
- Create E2E tests for device management flows
- Create E2E tests for user authentication flows
- Create E2E tests for monitoring dashboard flows
- Create E2E tests for analytics reporting flows
- Create E2E tests for critical business processes

#### Task 10.4: Implement Performance Tests
- Create load tests for API endpoints
- Create stress tests for database queries
- Create benchmark tests for command handlers
- Create benchmark tests for query handlers
- Create performance tests for real-time features

#### Task 10.5: Set Up Test Infrastructure
- Configure test database with test data
- Set up mock services for external dependencies
- Create test fixtures and factories
- Implement test utilities and helpers
- Configure CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

#### Task 10.6: Implement Code Quality Tools
- Set up ESLint with DDD-specific rules
- Configure Prettier for consistent code formatting
- Implement SonarQube for code quality analysis
- Set up test coverage reporting
- Implement pre-commit hooks for code quality checks

#### Task 10.7: Validate DDD Architecture
- Verify domain boundaries and isolation
- Check for proper encapsulation of domain logic
- Validate command and query separation
- Ensure proper event propagation
- Verify repository pattern implementation
- Check for proper use of value objects and entities

### âœ… Task 10.8: Phase 10 Validation
- Unit tests implemented with high coverage
- Integration tests passing for all components
- End-to-end tests passing for critical flows
- Performance tests showing acceptable results
- Test infrastructure set up and working
- Code quality tools configured and running
- DDD architecture validated and conforming to best practices
- All existing functionality still works
