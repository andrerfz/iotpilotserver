# üöÄ Updated IoT Pilot Server DDD Structure - Step 7

## üîå Task 7: Phase 7 - Device Domain - Use Cases (6-8 days)

### üéØ Overview
This phase focuses on implementing the application layer use cases for the Device domain using the CQRS pattern (Commands and Queries). These components provide the application-specific logic for interacting with the Device domain.

Context from steps before

```
All Command classes in the DDD migration should follow this pattern:
‚úÖ Correct Pattern
typescriptimport {Command} from '@/lib/shared/application/interfaces/command.interface';
import {Email} from '@/lib/user/domain/value-objects/email.vo';
import {Password} from '@/lib/user/domain/value-objects/password.vo';
import {UserRole} from '@/lib/user/domain/value-objects/user-role.vo';

export class RegisterUserCommand implements Command {
private constructor(
public readonly email: Email,
public readonly password: Password,
public readonly role: UserRole
) {}

    static create(
        email: string,
        password: string,
        role: string = 'USER'
    ): RegisterUserCommand {
        return new RegisterUserCommand(
            Email.create(email),
            Password.create(password),
            UserRole.create(role)
        );
    }
}
```

### üéØ Updated Migration Overview

This plan migrates the IoT Pilot Server from a traditional Next.js structure to a **Multi-Tenant Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** architecture in 13 phases, with each phase being tested and validated before proceeding to the next.

- **Timeline**: 7-9 weeks (assuming part-time work)
- **Strategy**: Incremental migration with backward compatibility
- **Architecture**: Multi-tenant DDD with customer isolation
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage at each phase including tenant isolation

### üè¢ Multi-Tenant Architecture Goals

1. **Complete Tenant Isolation**: Customer data fully segregated
2. **SUPERADMIN Capabilities**: Platform-wide management access
3. **Scalable Design**: Support for unlimited customers/organizations
4. **Security First**: Prevent cross-tenant data leakage
5. **DDD Compliance**: Clean domain boundaries with tenant awareness

### üîÑ Phase Dependencies

- **Phase 3** (Multi-Tenant) is foundational for all subsequent phases
- **Phases 4-12** will build upon the multi-tenant infrastructure
- Each domain (User, Device, Monitoring) will implement tenant-scoped patterns
- API routes and frontend will enforce tenant boundaries
- Testing will validate tenant isolation throughout

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Updated Risk Assessment

- **Phase 3** marked as **High Risk** due to foundational multi-tenant implementation
- Requires careful validation of tenant isolation before proceeding
- Database migration complexity increased with tenant boundaries
- Security testing becomes critical for preventing data leakage               | 2-3 days | Low        |

### üîÑ Preparation for Next Phases

This multi-tenant foundation will be consumed by:
- **Phase 4**: User Domain will extend tenant-aware patterns
- **Phase 5**: Device Domain will implement tenant-scoped entities
- **Phase 6**: Device services will use tenant context
- **Phase 7**: Device use cases will inherit tenant-aware commands/queries
- **Phase 8**: Monitoring will implement tenant-scoped metrics
- **Phase 9**: API routes will use tenant middleware
- **Phase 10**: Frontend will implement customer context
- **Phase 11**: Testing will validate multi-tenant scenarios
- **Phase 12**: CLI will generate tenant-aware components
- **Phase 13**: Documentation will cover multi-tenant architecture
