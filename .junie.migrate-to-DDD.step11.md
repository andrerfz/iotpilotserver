# 🚀 Updated IoT Pilot Server DDD Structure - Step 11

## 🧪 Task 11: Phase 11 - Testing & Validation (3-5 days)

### 🎯 Overview
This phase focuses on comprehensive testing and validation of the DDD architecture. We'll implement various types of tests to ensure the system works correctly, performs well, and maintains high code quality.

## Context from all steps

```
All Command classes in the DDD migration should follow this pattern:
✅ Correct Pattern
typescriptimport {Command} from '@/lib/shared/application/interfaces/command.interface';
import {Email} from '@/lib/user/domain/value-objects/email.vo';
import {Password} from '@/lib/user/domain/value-objects/password.vo';
import {UserRole} from '@/lib/user/domain/value-objects/user-role.vo';

export class RegisterUserCommand implements Command {
private constructor(
public readonly email: Email,
public readonly password: Password,
public readonly role: UserRole
) {}

    static create(
        email: string,
        password: string,
        role: string = 'USER'
    ): RegisterUserCommand {
        return new RegisterUserCommand(
            Email.create(email),
            Password.create(password),
            UserRole.create(role)
        );
    }
}
```

### 🎯 Updated Migration Overview

### 🏢 Multi-Tenant Architecture Goals

1. **Complete Tenant Isolation**: Customer data fully segregated
2. **SUPERADMIN Capabilities**: Platform-wide management access
3. **Scalable Design**: Support for unlimited customers/organizations
4. **Security First**: Prevent cross-tenant data leakage
5. **DDD Compliance**: Clean domain boundaries with tenant awareness

### 🔄 Phase Dependencies

- **Phases 4-12** will build upon the multi-tenant infrastructure
- Each domain (User, Device, Monitoring) will implement tenant-scoped patterns
- API routes and frontend will enforce tenant boundaries
- Testing will validate tenant isolation throughout

### ⚠️ Updated Risk Assessment

- Requires careful validation of tenant isolation before proceeding
- Database migration complexity increased with tenant boundaries
- Security testing becomes critical for preventing data leakage               | 2-3 days | Low        |

### 🔄 Preparation for Next Phases

This multi-tenant foundation will be consumed by:
- **Phase 4**: User Domain will extend tenant-aware patterns
- **Phase 5**: Device Domain will implement tenant-scoped entities
- **Phase 6**: Device services will use tenant context
- **Phase 7**: Device use cases will inherit tenant-aware commands/queries
- **Phase 8**: Monitoring will implement tenant-scoped metrics
- **Phase 9**: API routes will use tenant middleware
- **Phase 10**: Frontend will implement customer context
- **Phase 11**: Testing will validate multi-tenant scenarios
- **Phase 12**: CLI will generate tenant-aware components
- **Phase 13**: Documentation will cover multi-tenant architecture
