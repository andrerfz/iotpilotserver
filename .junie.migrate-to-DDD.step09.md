# üöÄ Updated IoT Pilot Server DDD Structure - Step 9

## üñ•Ô∏è Task 9: Phase 9 - Frontend Integration (5-7 days)

### üéØ Overview
This phase focuses on integrating the DDD backend with the frontend components. We'll create React hooks, context providers, and UI components that interact with the domain services through the command and query buses.

### üìã Tasks

#### Task 9.1: Create DDD Integration Context Providers
- Implement CommandBusProvider for executing commands
- Implement QueryBusProvider for executing queries
- Implement EventBusProvider for subscribing to domain events
- Implement DependencyInjectionProvider for managing service instances
- Create domain-specific context providers (DeviceContext, UserContext, MonitoringContext)

#### Task 9.2: Implement Domain-Specific React Hooks
- Create useCommand hook for executing domain commands
- Create useQuery hook for executing domain queries
- Create useDeviceCommands hook for device-specific commands
- Create useDeviceQueries hook for device-specific queries
- Create useUserCommands hook for user-specific commands
- Create useUserQueries hook for user-specific queries
- Create useMonitoringCommands hook for monitoring-specific commands
- Create useMonitoringQueries hook for monitoring-specific queries

#### Task 9.3: Create Real-Time Data Hooks
- Implement useWebSocket hook for WebSocket connections
- Implement useDeviceMetrics hook for real-time device metrics
- Implement useSshSession hook for SSH terminal sessions
- Implement useRealTimeAlerts hook for real-time alerts
- Implement useNotifications hook for system notifications

#### Task 9.4: Update Device UI Components
- Refactor DeviceList component to use domain hooks
- Refactor DeviceForm component to use domain commands
- Refactor DeviceDetails component to use domain queries
- Refactor DeviceMetrics component to use real-time hooks
- Refactor SshTerminal component to use SSH session hooks
- Create DeviceCommands component for executing device commands

#### Task 9.5: Update User UI Components
- Refactor UserList component to use domain hooks
- Refactor UserForm component to use domain commands
- Refactor UserProfile component to use domain queries
- Update LoginForm to use authentication commands
- Update RegisterForm to use registration commands

#### Task 9.6: Update Monitoring UI Components
- Refactor AlertList component to use domain hooks
- Refactor AlertDetails component to use domain queries
- Refactor MetricsDashboard component to use real-time hooks
- Create ThresholdConfig component for managing alert thresholds
- Create ReportGenerator component for creating monitoring reports

#### Task 9.7: Create Integration Tests
- Write tests for command hooks
- Write tests for query hooks
- Write tests for real-time data hooks
- Write tests for UI components with domain integration
- Create end-to-end tests for critical user flows

### ‚úÖ Task 9.8: Phase 9 Validation
- DDD integration context providers implemented
- Domain-specific React hooks implemented
- Real-time data hooks implemented
- Device UI components updated to use domain hooks
- User UI components updated to use domain hooks
- Monitoring UI components updated to use domain hooks
- Integration tests passing
- End-to-end tests passing
- All existing functionality still works
